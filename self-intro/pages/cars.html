    <h3>My 1976 MG Midget Project</h3>

      <p>
        My pride and joy is my 1976 MG Midget, a classic British roadster that
        I’ve been restoring since I was 18. I bought it just a week after my
        birthday, and it’s been my ultimate classic car restoration project ever
        since. The MG Midget’s compact design, timeless style, and the thrill of
        bringing an old car back to life make it a dream to work on. I’ve spent
        countless hours tinkering with the engine, fixing up the interior, and
        learning the ins and outs of working on cars. Every challenge—whether
        it’s sourcing rare parts or troubleshooting engine issues—has taught me
        patience and problem-solving. There’s nothing more rewarding than
        hearing that engine roar after hours of hard work. The MG Midget isn’t
        just a car; it’s a passion project that keeps me inspired.

    <h3>My Daily Drivers</h3>

      <p>
        While the MG Midget is my passion project, my daily drivers keep me
        grounded. I rely on my trusty Toyota Highlander (Unnamed) for
        everyday life and road trips—it’s the perfect blend of comfort and
        reliability. Then there’s my ’98 Chevy S10 (Darlene), a
        rugged beater truck that’s seen its fair share of adventures. It’s not
        the prettiest, but it’s a reminder that cars don’t have to be perfect
        to be loved. Whether hauling 1,300lbs of scrap, or going out on
        the town, ol’ Darlene has stood by me. For me, cars are more than
        just machines—they’re a way to express creativity, learn new skills, and
        spend time productively alone.
