          Thanks for visiting! I'm learning how to build websites and work with
          computers from the ground up. This site is where I keep track of my
          progress, share what I'm learning, and experiment with new ideas.
          Right now, I'm focused on front-end development, especially HTML and
          CSS. I'm also getting more comfortable working in Linux and writing
          Bash scripts to automate little tasks and customize my system. I like
          having control over how things work—it makes using a computer way more
          fun. This site isn't just to show off (I'm still new to all this), but
          to document how I grow. You'll find some blog posts about what I'm
          learning, a contact page if you want to get in touch, and a “sandbox”
          where I keep random coding experiments and mini-projects. My goal is
          to get better every week. Even small steps count. Whether I'm styling
          a basic webpage or figuring out how to write a Bash script to back up
          my files, I'm always learning something new. Feel free to explore, and
          if you're learning too—cool! Maybe we can help each other out.
