            This page is all about things I’ve been experimenting with. I call
            it my “sandbox” because it’s where I test new ideas, mess around
            with code, and try out fun stuff without worrying about making it
            perfect. Sometimes I build small tools, like a calculator or a to-do
            list. Other times I try to recreate cool effects I’ve seen online,
            like a glowing button or a cool animation. These aren’t big
            projects—they’re just little pieces of learning. But every time I
            work in the sandbox, I pick up something new.

                While the links may not work, along with the email sign-up, the
                intent of this page was SEO enhancement. A lot of those elements
                were added for style, but could be turned into something real in
                the future.

                A script I spent a full day on, whose only intent was to back-up

          <p id="list-title">Here are a few things I’ve tried:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A quiz app in Flutter</li>
            <li>A Bash script to automate weekly and monthly backups</li>
            <li>Creating interactive buttons with CSS</li>
            <li>Practice with Tables and making a calender</li>
          </ul>

            It’s fun to break things and fix them. That’s how I learn. I don’t
            always know what I’m doing at first, but I try, Google a lot, and
            figure things out piece by piece. If you're learning too, I
            recommend having your own sandbox. You don't have to build something
            huge. Just start with one idea and go from there. That’s what I do.
