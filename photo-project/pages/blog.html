        <h3>What HTML Means to Me</h3>
        <img src="../content/webpage.png" alt="Webpage built by Damien Rose using HTML" id="img1">
        <p>
          When I first started learning about websites, I kept hearing people
          talk about HTML. I had no idea what it meant or why it mattered. At
          first, I thought it was just some kind of code that only super smart
          people could use. But once I actually sat down and started learning
          it, I realized it’s not that scary. HTML stands for “HyperText Markup
          Language,” which sounds kind of fancy, but it’s actually pretty
          simple. I like to think of it as the skeleton or bones of a website.
          It gives everything a place and a purpose. With HTML, I can tell the
          browser where text should go, where to put an image, how to make a
          list, or even where to link to another page. One of the coolest things
          about HTML is how fast I can see what I’ve made. I write a few lines
          of code, save the file, and open it in my browser—and boom! There it
          is. That part is really rewarding. It feels like I’m building
          something real, even if it’s small. I’ve learned how to make
          paragraphs, headers, lists, links, and even add images and videos. I
          didn’t realize how much goes into just one simple webpage. Every part
          has to be placed using HTML, and that structure is what other code
          (like CSS and JavaScript) builds on. Without HTML, none of it would
          work. What I like most is how beginner-friendly it is. You don’t need
          fancy tools—just a text editor and a browser. It makes learning to
          code feel possible, even if you’re starting with zero experience.
          Every time I build a new page, I understand the internet a little
          better. I’m glad I started with HTML because it makes me feel like I’m
          actually creating something from scratch. Now when I visit websites, I
          can recognize what’s happening behind the scenes, and that’s a pretty
          awesome feeling.

        <h3>Why I Like Using Linux</h3>
        <img src="../content/linux.png" alt="Linux logo" id="img2">
        <p>
          When I first heard about Linux, I didn’t really know what it was. I
          thought it was just for hackers or super smart tech people. But once I
          tried it, I realized that Linux is actually really cool—and not as
          hard as I thought. It’s an operating system, kind of like Windows or
          macOS, but it gives you way more control over your computer. You can
          change how everything looks, use powerful tools, and even bring old
          computers back to life. One of my favorite parts of using Linux is the
          terminal. At first, the command line looked kind of scary. It’s just a
          black screen with text, and you type in commands to do stuff. But once
          I learned a few basic commands, it started to feel like I was talking
          directly to the computer. I can move files, install programs, update
          my system, and do all kinds of things without even touching the mouse.
          It makes me feel like I really own my computer, not the other way
          around. I’ve been learning to write small Bash scripts too. These are
          little programs that I write myself to automate things, like cleaning
          up my folders or backing up files. It’s fun to type out a few lines,
          save the script, and have it do something useful for me. It saves time
          and helps me learn how computers really work under the hood. Another
          reason I like Linux is that there are so many choices. I’m currently
          using a version called BackBox, which is built for security and
          hacking tools, but still good for everyday stuff. There are also
          lightweight versions you can use on older computers, and others that
          are super customizable. If you want to change your desktop theme,
          icons, or even how your system boots, you can do it. Some things do
          take more effort to learn, but that’s part of the fun. It pushes me to
          figure stuff out, and when I do, I feel like I’ve really earned it.
          Linux has taught me a lot about computers, scripting, and even
          security. I’m glad I gave it a try, and I’d recommend it to anyone who
          wants to dig a little deeper into how computers really work.

        <h3>What's Next?</h3>
        <img src="../content/js1.webp" alt="HTML example that says JavaScript for some reason?" id="img3">
        <p>
          Now that I’ve learned the basics of HTML and CSS, I’m starting to look
          ahead at what’s next—and that’s JavaScript. From what I understand,
          JavaScript is what makes websites do things, instead of just sitting
          there. It’s how buttons know to open menus, how forms get submitted,
          how animations happen, and even how games are made. Basically, it adds
          action to your website. I’ve only messed with a little bit of
          JavaScript so far, and it seems both exciting and a little
          intimidating. There are a lot of new words and rules, and sometimes I
          have to look up what things mean. But I’m really curious to learn
          more, because I want to make interactive websites—not just ones that
          look nice. I’d love to create a site where someone can click a button,
          and something cool happens. Or maybe a simple game or calculator.
          That’s the kind of stuff I think would be really fun to build. Besides
          JavaScript, I’ve also started learning some things in the Linux world.
          I use Linux as my main operating system, and I’ve been writing small
          Bash scripts to help with stuff like cleaning up files or making
          backups. It’s cool how you can tell your computer what to do with just
          a few lines in the terminal. I think this kind of scripting will help
          me later when I work with servers or need to automate things.
          Eventually, I want to understand how websites connect to databases and
          how full web apps work. Like, how does a login page actually save your
          info? How does a shopping cart remember what you picked? I want to
          build something real that stores and shows data, maybe even using
          tools like Node.js or Python someday. There’s a lot to learn, but I’m
          excited about it. Every time I figure something new out, it makes me
          want to keep going. I might not be an expert yet, but I know I’m
          heading in the right direction.
