            I haven’t gotten into JavaScript yet, but it’s on the list. For now,
            I’m focused on building solid foundations. I enjoy writing blog
            posts about things I figure out and putting my work into a sandbox
            where I can break stuff, fix it, and learn from it.

            Hi, I'm Damien. I'm 19, based in Illinois, and I've always liked
            figuring out how things work. Before I started learning to build
            websites, I was mostly into cars and mechanical stuff. Now I'm
            shifting that curiosity into tech—especially Linux and web
            development. Right now, I’m learning the basics of HTML and CSS, and
            I’m using Bash to write simple scripts that make my system work the
            way I want. I use Linux as my daily OS, and I’ve been exploring
            different distros, terminal setups, and automating backups. I like
            working close to the system—it feels powerful and lightweight.
          </p>
          <img
            src="../content/horror.jpg"
            alt="X-Ray style image of young boy holding his head"
            style="width: 95%"
          />
          <p>
            Outside of tech, I still mess with cars and guitars when I can. I
            like working with my hands and solving problems, whether that’s in
            the garage or at the keyboard. I built this portfolio to track what
            I’m learning, not to pretend I’m an expert. If you’re new to coding
            too, we’re probably in the same boat. Let’s learn as we go.
